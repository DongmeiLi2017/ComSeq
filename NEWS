ComSeq is a new RNA-seq differential analysis package using ensemble method of four commonly used differential analysis methods 
including DESeq2, EBSeq, SAMSeq, and NOISeq. This ensemble method use results from the four RNA-seq differential analysis methods 
and declare a gene is significantly differentially expressed only when the gene is detected significant by all four methods. The 
rank of selected genes is based on a weighted algorithm that assign more weights on genes detected by the DESeq2 and EBSeq methods 
than the SAMSeq and NOISeq methods. The ensemble method has much lower false discovery rate than all other popular RNA-Seq 
differential analysis methods especially when sample size is as small as three shown in our simulation studies. The ensemble method 
greatly increases the probability of true positive findings for studies with small sample sizes.
