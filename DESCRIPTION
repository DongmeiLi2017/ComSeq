Description: This ensemble method use results from four current RNA-seq differential analysis methods (DESeq2, EBSeq, SAMSeq, NOISeq) and 
             declare a gene is significantly differentially expressed only when the gene is detected significant by all four methods. The 
             rank of selected genes is based on a weighted algorithm that assign more weights on genes detected by the DESeq2 and EBSeq 
             methods than the SAMSeq and NOISeq methods.
